My name is **Nathan Davis**, but you can call me Nate. I'm a third year economics, statistics, and computer science student at Michigan State University focusing on data science and computational modeling. Before starting a data science internship at Teradata in San Diego, I previously worked for the breakfast company Kellogg's developing predictive models for marketing and trade promotions. 

I currently sit on the executive board of the Michigan State University Data Science Assocation. When on campus, I focus on developing machine learning driven solutions for computational genomics and biomedical studies in the MSU Krishnan Lab. 

My fascination is network science, specifically social and ecological networks. Much of my research focuses on applying techiniques from this domain to various areas such as computational economics, behavior diffusion and adoption, political science, and ecology. 

I grew up in southern Florida before moving north to Battle Creek, Michigan in 2005. I've come to appreicate the Midwest, and even call it home. Hobbies include hiking, reading, video games, and recreational data analysis. For as long as I can remember, I have been a massive Lord of the Rings fan, as well as enjoying (maybe too much at times) Star Wars, Harry Potter, and anything Batman. I currently live in sunny San Diego with my girlfriend and puppy Austrailian Shepard, Kona.
