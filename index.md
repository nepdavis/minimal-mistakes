My name is **Nathan Davis**, but you can call me Nate. I'm a third year economics, statistics, and computer science student at Michigan State University focusing on data science and computational modeling. Before starting a data science internship at Teradata in San Diego, I previously worked for the breakfast company Kellogg's developing predictive models for marketing and trade promotions.
