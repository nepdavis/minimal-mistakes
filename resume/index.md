Data science simply cannot be reduced to a Venn diagram or a three-legged stool. It's an intricate and complex discipline that pulls from a wide variety of techniques and domains. It's important to discuss the different tools and strategies we use to cultivate understanding from data.

## Programming Languages

For the past two years my main language has been **Python**. I have used it extensively for data manipulation, analysis and machine learning, and algorithm development. That experience includes widely used packages such as NumPy, SciPy, sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, matplotlib, folium, bokeh, networkx, CVXPY, and more. I often use **R** for statistical analysis, and have for years; more about that later on.

I also have experience with **C/C++**, mainly using it for algorithm development and in various coursework.

Other languages I have exposure to or some experience with are:
* **Java**, through various coursework
* **Matlab**, testing out statistical approaches
* **Julia**, after trying it out and comparing it to Pythona and Matlab

I would love the opportunity to be exposed to and pick up **Scala**, **Go**, or **Rust**.
