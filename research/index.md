### Network and Regression Analysis of Presidential Elections Since 1964
June 2017 - Present

Network analysis of state voting behavior in every presidential election since the District of Columbia was added to the electoral college in 1964. This research focuses on identifying true swing states with the largest impact, the ability D.C. has as an effective predictor of election outcomes, and the effect of a single vote based on margin and electoral density.

### Application of Bass Adoption Models to Google Trends Data
May 2017 - Present

I apply the Bass adoption model to cumulative Google Trends search volume index data of various contagious and viral behaviors, like the ALS Ice Bucket Challange, recent fake news stories, fidget spinners, and more. From here we can discern the levels of innovation and imitation within the social networks through which these behaviors spread.

### *Krishnan Lab*, High Dimensional Regression Prediction of Lung Gene Expression
May 2017 - Present

This study is being carried out under the supervision of Prof. Arjun Krishnan in the MSU Krishnan Lab. I use various dimensionality reduction and regression techniques to generate thousands of models to predict levels of expression for tens of thousands of genes in various tissues using only blood sample gene expression levels.
