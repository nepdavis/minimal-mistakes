### *Krishnan Lab*, High Dimensional Regression Prediction of Lung Gene Expression
May 2017 - Present

This study is being carried out under the supervision of Prof. Arjun Krishnan in the MSU Krishnan Lab. I use various dimensionality reduction and regression techniques to generate thousands of models to predict levels of expression for tens of thousands of genes in various tissues using only blood sample gene expression levels.
